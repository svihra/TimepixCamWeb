document.write('TimepixCam is able to record and time-stamp light flashes in excess of 1,000 photons with high quantum efficiency in the 400â€“1000nm wavelength range with 20ns timing resolution, corresponding to an effective rate of 50 Megaframes per second. ')
document.write('The camera was used for imaging ions impinging on a microchannel plate followed by a phosphor screen. Possible applications include spatial and velocity map imaging of ions in time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; coincidence imaging of ions and electrons, and other time-resolved types of imaging spectroscopy.<\p>')
